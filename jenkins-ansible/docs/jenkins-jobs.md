# Part 4: Automating with Jenkins & Ansible

Once Jenkins and Ansible are set up, the next step is to define what jobs and playbooks will deliver. To keep things simple and structured, we organize jobs into two categories:

- **Administrative Tools** â†’ System-level operations like backups, server hardening, and configuration.
- **Hosting Management Portal** â†’ Application & website lifecycle management (add, remove, enable, disable, etc.).

For better readability, create the following folders inside Jenkins:

- `Administrative Tools`
- `Hosting Management Portal`

Once you followed & setup all jobs, you will have jenkins jobs structure like this:

![Dashboard](../images/dashboard.png)
![Administrative Tools](../images/administrative_tools.png)
![Hosting Management Portal](../images/hosting_management_portal.png)

## Recommended Flow

To ensure a smooth setup, run jobs in the following sequence:

1. **server_hardening** â†’ Secure the base OS with CIS benchmark, SSH restrictions, firewall rules, etc.
2. **configure_web_server** â†’ Apply Apache configuration (virtual hosts, authentication, PHP-FPM integration).
3. **php_install** â†’ Install and configure PHP with required extensions for your environment.

This flow ensures your server is hardened, the web layer is properly configured, and PHP is ready for hosting applications.
